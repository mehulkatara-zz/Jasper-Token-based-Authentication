# Token Based Authentication

If you have an application or portal you want to use with JasperReports Server, but do not have an existing single sign-on environment, you can use the Jaspersoft token-based authentication and user management framework. To work with token-based authentication.

* There are two way of token based authentication

    - With encryption mechanism
  
    - Without encryption mechanism
    
    
> **Note : Never use without encryption mechanism for production**
